\section{Step 2: Segment Nuclei}

Here, we will segment the nuclei in the image of the first channel \textbf{"C1-Small.tif"}. We would like to ignore deformed (Fig.~\ref{fig:NucDeformed}) and unusually small (Fig.~\ref{fig:NucSmall}) or large nuclei. In addition, the algorithm should identify touching nuclei (Fig.~\ref{fig:NucTwo}) so that these clusters are either ignored or properly split.

\subsection{Workflow}

We will first perform some manual processing on the image of the first channel to understand each step. After this we write a macro to perform these operations automatically (see Module 2 for an introduction of the macro programming language). Leave the command recorder open to record operations as you manually perform them.%\ref{sec:ImageJMacroBasics}
