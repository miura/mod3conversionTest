\section{Step 1: Initialization---a short warm-up}

\subsection{Workflow}

In Fiji, perform the steps described in this section with the command recorder open and create a macro from the recorder.
We will use the image \textbf{Small.tif}.

This hyperstack (4 channels) is a crop view from of a single field of a confocal dataset.
Each image is a maximum intensity projection, per channel, of the original data. 
The first image is a staining for the nuclei, all subsequent images are acquired in the fluorescence channels of the FISH stainings.
